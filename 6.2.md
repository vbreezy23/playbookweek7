there’s a lot of concern about how much information companies like Apple and Google collect from people who use smartphones. 
Governments are paying more attention to privacy, especially because some advertisers track what people do on their phones to show them targeted ads.

What Are the Main Privacy Laws Right Now?

In the United States, there isn’t one big law about privacy. Some states have their own privacy laws, like California’s CCPA and CPRA. These laws give people more rights to see, delete, or stop the sale of their personal data.

In 2025, more states, like Delaware and Minnesota, are making new laws to protect users’ personal information. These usually let people:

See what data is collected about them

Ask for it to be deleted

Say no to their data being sold or used for ads

There is talk of one law for the whole country, called the “American Privacy Rights Act,” but it hasn’t passed yet.

In Europe, the GDPR law is much stricter. It forces companies to get permission before collecting or using any personal data.

Are These Laws Good Enough?

Some of these laws are helpful, but many people still don’t understand what data is being collected or how it’s used.

Because there’s no single law in the U.S., companies have to follow different rules in every state, which is confusing.

Even with new laws, big companies sometimes find ways to collect data in less obvious ways, like with Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) or device fingerprinting.

Advertisers sometimes watch what people do to show them more ads, which many people think is “creepy.”

Should More Be Done to Protect Users?

Yes — most 8th graders and even adults don’t read privacy policies or understand how their apps share data.

Companies should be more clear about what information they collect and why.

The government should make simple, easy-to-understand rules for all of the U.S., so everyone’s data is equally protected.

Privacy settings should be easier to find and use, and tracking for ads should default to “off” unless a user says yes.

My Recommendations

Make one simple privacy law for the entire country, so it’s easy to understand.

Make all companies clearly explain what data they collect and let users say “no.”

Require companies to ask before tracking users, especially kids and teens.

Teach kids and teens in school about digital privacy, so they know how to protect themselves.

Conclusion

There are some good laws to help protect our data, but they aren’t enough yet — especially in the U.S. We need stronger rules that are 
easy to understand so everyone can keep their information private. I think it would be better for regular people, especially kids, if
tech companies and the government worked together to make privacy a bigger priority.
