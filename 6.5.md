Most of my friends know turning off location services is good, but find it annoying, so their “likeliness” scores are lower. 
For strong passwords, we are all pretty good because apps make it easy now. Not sharing personal stuff online is tough and everyone 
sometimes messes up. Updates only get skipped if our devices take forever to restart.

My Additional Privacy Best Practices
Check app permissions every month (Score: Privacy 4 / Likely B)

Go through phone settings and see which apps have access to stuff like contacts and photos. Remove access for any weird apps.

Cover camera/webcam when not in use (Score: Privacy 5 / Likely C)

Stickers or camera covers are cheap, but I usually forget to use one.

Log out from accounts you’re not using (Score: Privacy 5 / Likely B)

Helps stop accidental leaks. It’s hard because some accounts stay logged in by default.

What I Learned
This activity helped me really look at how easy (or hard) it is to follow privacy tips, even when I know they’re good ideas! I realized some 
things (like passwords) are easy thanks to technology, but other things (like turning off location or keeping info private) just take more effort
and reminders. My friends also have similar habits—most of us forget or “get lazy” about certain tips, so it’s not just about knowing what to do, 
it’s about being motivated and making it a habit.

The best new practices are simple and only take a little time, but make a big difference. I think privacy is important, and this assignment made
me want to check my settings and pay more attention to what I share online.
