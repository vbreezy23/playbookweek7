VPNs That Compromised User Security

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are supposed to protect your privacy online. But, some VPNs have made things worse by keeping records (logs) of 
websites people visit and even sharing that information. In 2020, security researchers found that 7 VPNs—including UFO VPN, Fast VPN, and Free
VPN—stored activity logs and left 1.2 terabytes of user data open on the internet. This included what websites people visited, and even private
info like email addresses and passwords. These VPNs promised “no logs” but didn’t keep that promise.

Other cases showed that free VPNs, in particular, sometimes logged user information and leaked it online or gave it to advertisers. 
This totally goes against what VPNs are meant to do—protect your privacy!

Reviewing the Terms of Three VPNs

I looked at the privacy policies for ExpressVPN, NordVPN, and Proton VPN—three popular paid VPNs.

ExpressVPN: States they do not collect logs of your online activity (browsing history, websites visited, IP addresses, etc.). 
They say their systems are designed to “not have sensitive data about customers” and have been checked by outside audits.

NordVPN: Says they follow a strict “no-logs” policy, don’t track websites visited or IP addresses, and are based in Panama (where 
they aren’t required to keep logs). Their privacy policy says they can’t share info they don’t have.

Proton VPN: Also a “no-logs” VPN, based in Switzerland (with strong privacy laws). They specifically say they do not log users’ 
traffic or session data, and have had independent audits and legal cases to prove it.

Verification of Claims

The best way to know if a VPN really follows a “no-logs” policy is through:

External audits by independent companies (all three above have done this).

Real-life legal cases: For example, in some cases, when governments asked Proton VPN or NordVPN for logs about users, the
companies had nothing to give because they didn’t keep records.

Which Would I Choose?

Based on my research, I would choose Proton VPN. It’s based in Switzerland, which has super strong privacy laws, and its
no-logs claims have been double-checked by both audits and real-world experience. ExpressVPN and NordVPN are also good 
options and have similar policies, but Proton VPN’s location and simple privacy terms seem best (especially for students).

Conclusion

Some VPNs have broken promises and even put their users at risk by keeping and leaking logs. That’s why it’s important
to read the privacy policy and look for outside audits or court cases to prove claims. For the best privacy, I would pick
a paid VPN like Proton VPN that has a proven record of protecting users and is honest about its policies.
