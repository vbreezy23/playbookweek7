Questions to ask your friends:

Do you know what location services are on your smartphone?

Do you ever turn location services on or off? Why or why not?

Do you know what a MAID (Mobile Advertising ID) is?

Have you ever heard of advertisers tracking you using your smartphone?

Do you think your school monitors what you do on your devices? If yes, how do you think they use that information?

Do you feel comfortable with the amount of privacy you have on your phone? Why or why not?

Sample Friends’ Answers:

Friend 1:

Yes, it helps apps find where you are, like maps.

I leave it on so games work, but my parents say I should turn it off more.

No idea what MAID is.

I heard advertisers do that, but I don’t really get how.

Maybe, because we have to log in on the school WiFi. I’m not sure what they do with it.

I feel okay, but sometimes I get weird ads that seem to know stuff about me.

Friend 2:

I think it shows where I am to apps.

I turn it off sometimes to save battery.

Never heard of MAID.

Yes, I saw a YouTube video about it.

I think teachers can see what we look up. They might use it to keep us safe.

Not really, because my parents say all my stuff is tracked.

Friend 3:

No, not really sure.

I always leave it on.

Nope, what’s that?

My brother said advertisers can see what apps you use.

Maybe, I got in trouble once after looking up stuff I shouldn’t have.

I don’t really think about it. 
After asking my friends these questions, I learned that most kids know a little bit about privacy on their phones, but not that much. 
Most of them know that location services can track them, but they aren’t sure why it matters. None of them knew what a MAID was, 
and only some heard about advertisers tracking them. Everyone thought the school might watch what they do, but were unsure how schools use that info.
My friends seem to care more about privacy when someone brings it up, but don’t do much to protect themselves. 
Most just leave things like location services on because it’s easier, or they don’t really understand the risks.
I think more people our age should learn about these topics, because it’s important to know who can see what we do on our phones and how to stay safe.
