Since 2010, Apple has made a lot of changes to better protect user privacy on iPhones. When iPhones first came out, privacy wasn’t talked about much, but now it’s a big reason why people buy Apple devices.

Timeline of Apple Privacy Changes:

2015: Apple let people use “Content Blockers” on Safari to stop ads and trackers.

2017: They added “Intelligent Tracking Prevention” (ITP), which makes it harder for advertisers to follow users around the web.

2020: Apple made app developers tell users what data they collect. This is on every app’s page in the App Store.

2021: With “App Tracking Transparency” (ATT), apps must ask permission before tracking users. Most people say no! There’s also “Mail Privacy Protection” to hide when and where you open emails.

2023-2025: Apple keeps making updates like hiding tracking IDs in Safari, locking private tabs, and making privacy tools easier to use. The new “Apple Intelligence” AI does stuff right on your phone, not in the cloud, so no one else can see your info.

Why Did Apple Make These Changes?
Apple wants people to trust them. More people are also worried about big companies using their phones to track them and sell ads. Laws in Europe (GDPR) and California especially made Apple step up privacy changes to avoid getting in legal trouble.

Are These Changes Sufficient?
Apple’s changes are strong—most people can stop apps from tracking them, and more stuff stays on your phone, not in the cloud. But Apple still collects some data, and sometimes updates (like iOS 17) re-enable tracking settings without asking. Also, even though privacy is strong, it’s not perfect: no device is 100% private.

Apple vs. Google Android: Which Is Better for Privacy?

Apple: Keeps a tight grip over apps and privacy settings. Data like voice commands and new AI tools mostly stay on your device. Apple asks before tracking and explains why.

Android (Google): Has a lot of privacy tools, but Google makes most of its money from ads and personal data, so there are more ways for companies and apps to track you. You have to spend more time changing settings yourself. Updates might arrive slower, and each phone brand (like Samsung, Pixel, etc.) changes privacy options.

Conclusion:

Apple iPhones have better privacy for most people because of their strict rules, on-device processing, and asking for permission to track.

However, both Apple and Google still get some data from users, and being truly private means understanding settings and being careful with what you share.

If privacy is your biggest concern, iPhone is the best pick. But the most important thing anyone can do is learn about their settings, update their phone, and be smart about what they share online.
